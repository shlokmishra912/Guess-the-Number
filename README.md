# Guess-the-Number
🎮 Python Number Guessing Game 🎮 This is a simple interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.

- The computer gives hints:
- "Lower Number plzz...." if your guess is too high
- "Higher Number plzz...." if your guess is too low
- Tracks the number of attempts you take to find the correct answer
- Ends with a congratulatory message once you guess correctly
🧑‍💻 Learning Highlights:
- Use of random.randint() for generating random numbers
